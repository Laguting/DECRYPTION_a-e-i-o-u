>💻 This is a code for decrypting an encrypted inputs by the user where **'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !**. Developed using python language.

# DESCRIPTION 📝
 - If the user encountered an encrypted message where its vowels is assigned to a specific symbols similar to this ('a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !). 
 - It uses tuple to hold the corresponding symbols to each vowels. Then, it'll check each character inputted and replace it by its designated letter.
 - The program used a step by step checking in the form of if, elif, and else statments.
 - It is also enhanced by using pyfiglet and termcolor for presentation.
 
 ### How to use the program using IDE 👩🏽‍💻?
 1. Copy the code to your preferred IDE.
 2. Open the terminal and run the code.
 3. The program will then ask for the encrypted code that you have in mind.
 4. Enter the encrypted code and then the program will process it.
 5. The decrypted code will be displayed on the screen.
